            <b>Csearch</b> (Clustering Search Engine) is being developed for the final Year
            Project of Computer Engineering project(IOE,pulchowk Campus).This project
            is sponsored and supervised by <b>D2Hawkeye Services.</b>

        <h3>About the Project</h3>
        <p>
            The World Wide Web is a store of huge information and continues to grow
            at an amazing speed. <br>Due to the huge size, high dynamics, and large
            diversity of the web it has become a very challenging task to find 
            the truly relevant content. <br>The standard web search engines (Google,
            Yahoo) have low precision, since typically a large number of irrelevant
            web pages are returned together with a small number of relevant pages.<br>
            Consequently, a web search engine typically returns long lists of
            results, but the user, in his limited amount of time, processes only 
            the first few results. <br>Thus, a lot of truly relevant information hidden
            in the long result lists will never be discovered.<br> cSearch
            is an extension to the standard search engines that returns the
            clusters of the results taken from standard search engines based on
            conceptual matching of the results.
